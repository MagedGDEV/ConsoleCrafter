# ConsoleCrafter

This repository is dedicated to creating a powerful and flexible C++ library for designing **beautiful console applications**. The library will allow developers to enhance terminal output with **interactive elements**, **colorful designs**, and **stylish text formatting**. Whether you're building simple utilities or complex command-line interfaces, this library will help transform your console into an engaging and interactive user experience.

## Next Steps

With the **must-have features** now completed and thoroughly tested, the next step is to **organize** and **package** them into a fully functional library. The goal is to publish a **binary file** for developers, so they can use the library in their projects just like any standard C++ library, without the need to manually download or include source files.

## Features Roadmap

### **Must-Have Features** (High Priority)

- [x] **Clear Screen**
  - Clear the terminal screen to provide a clean slate for new content.
- [x] **Colorful Text**
  - Display text in various colors to improve visual clarity and appeal.
- [x] **Selection Prompts**
  - Allow users to select between multiple items in a single-choice prompt.
- [x] **Multi-Selection Prompts**
  - Enable users to choose multiple items from a list.
- [x] **Styled Text**
  - Add support for text styling, including:
    - Underline
    - Bold
    - Dim
    - Strikethrough

**Compatibility:**  
All features have been **tested and completed**, and they are fully functional on macOS, Windows 10, and Linux (Raspberry Pi 2 [1GB RAM]).

#### **Planned Enhancements** (Next in Line)

- [ ] **Tables**
  - Create dynamic tables with adjustable column sizes that handle any text type.
- [ ] **Borders for Text**
  - Add customizable borders around text using characters like `|`, `-`, and `#`.
- [ ] **Large Font Text**
  - Allow the creation of text in large, artistic fonts for headers or emphasis.

##### **Future Aspirations** (Advanced Features)

- [ ] **Loading Bars**
  - Show progress bars for tasks and operations.
- [ ] **Page Layouts**
  - Create structured layouts for better organization of terminal content.
- [ ] **Trees**
  - Render hierarchical data as expandable/collapsible trees.
- [ ] **Bar Charts**
  - Display data visually using bar charts.

## Goals

This project is designed to:

- **Simplify terminal application development** by providing a rich set of tools for customization and interactivity.
- **Produce a reusable library** that is community-friendly and easy to integrate into any C++ project.
